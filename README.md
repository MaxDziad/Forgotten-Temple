It's my first game I made, together with @Kamil ≈Åukasik from scratch, in order to pass the study course.
100% written in Java, graphics handled by Java AWT and Swing libraries.

Genre: Platform 2D

Completion time: 5 minutes

As a player we can move, jump and attack with lasso. In order to complete the game, we need to move throught the platforms, bypass or defeat slime enemies and make to the Temple at the end of the stage.
In the temple there will be boss fight with temple guardian. In order to defeat him, you need to kite his attack, jump over him and attack his weak point behind him.
The less life he will have, the less opportunities to attack him you will have. Good luck!
